                - Model/controller - small preact signals module that holds the model and shares a signal for the model value
                - Store - a module to persist the model to local storage, will also be used by the model/controller to fetch initial state
                - Enactor - small component to output the model value to the page. Consumes a signal/effect
                - Adjuster (preact) - a preact component that consumes a signal from the model/controller and can adjust the value
                - Adjuster (web component) - a small webcomponent that consumes a signal/effect form the model/controller and can adjust the value
